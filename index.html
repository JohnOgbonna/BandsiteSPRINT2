      <p class="story__container-paragraph1">Lil' Scrappy (born Carl Marcus Johnnson II) is an MC from Southern Califronia. At the age of 12, his father was killed by gang voilence, leaving him and his mother to fend for themselves. Growing up, Carl was an honor role student, usually scoring at the top of his class. He worked hard after school at his part time job as a janitor to help his mom make ends meet. When times were tough, Carl sometimes would trun to the streets to make a bit of extra money, as he felt there was no other way. However, he always knew to keep his distance from that kind of life. With a natural affinity for music, Carl would write songs and produce beats on his free time. Despite qualifying for State University, Carl decided to take up the mantra as Lil' Scrappy and partner with a fellow local artist, Big Bobby to launch a Hip-Hop duo</p> 
      <p class="story__container-paragraph2">Better known by his stage name "Big Bobby", Robert Mangus Carter had a dangerous and interesting past. At the age of 15, he joined a street gang in search of guidance, as his father was not around due to substance abuse. Living on the streets for peroids of up to 6 months at a time, dropping out of school at the age of 16, Robert did not feel as if he had a choice other than crime. "There was no other path. Me and the homies would steal, sell drugs and other things to stay alive. But later on it became about the power. I became someone who I hardly recognize"-Robert Carter. In an effort to change his life, Robert left the gang at the age of 26 and began training and working as a plumber. With a passion for music that he had for as long as he could remeber, Robert picked up the alias Big Bobby, teamed up with Lil' Scrappy and the rest is history.</p>
